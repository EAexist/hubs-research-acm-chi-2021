    "The data is captured from the [bespoke Hubs Cloud Client](https://github.com/ayman/hubs/tree/hubs-cloud/src/systems/research) is sampled at the end user's frames per seconds.  This sampling rate data varies between users with different hardware capabilities.  To effectively analyse the data, it must first be resampled at a consistent rate.\n",

The CSV was also given simplified column names, columns not used for this analysis were removed, and any columns with personally identifying information were removed."

This is substantially sparser than the logging code is capable of, but in the interest of optimisation during our workshop deployment, we did not push the performance of the client side logger in this case.  In follow-on work, we tested the performance of real-time logging and succeeded with significantly higher sampling rates.  "
